# Microsoft Office Cookbook
[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/msoffice.svg)](https://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/msoffice)

This Chef cookbook installs Microsoft Office 2013 from an ISO.
It is working fine, but is not fully completed. You're welcome to contribute!

# Requirements

This cookbook requires 7-zip to be installed so it can extract the ISO. To ensure this happens this cookbook includes the 7-zip default recipe.

It was successfully tested on:
- Windows 2012 Server (R2)
- Windows 10 Pro

Also it should work on:
- Windows 7
- Windows 2008 Server (R2)
- Windows 8 (8.1)


# Usage

Set the `node['msoffice']['source']` attribute to the download location of the MS Office ISO and add 'visualstudio::default' to your runlist. For example: http://example.com/installs

By default this cookbook assumes you're installing Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus.

# Attributes

## Required
* `node['msoffice']['source']` - Required, fully qualified http(s) path to the ISO directory. For example: http://example.com/installs

## Optional
